# PowerBash

PowerBash is a comprehensive, user-scoped environment configuration suite that supercharges your
command-line productivity. It provides a highly customized Bash shell, advanced Git integration,
a powerful tmux setup, and a feature-rich Vim environment with pre-configured plugins, all designed
for convenience, clarity, and efficiency.


## Features

### üñ•Ô∏è Enhanced Bash Environment

- **Custom PS1 Prompt:**  
  - Shows command return code status (`x` for failure, `o` for success).
  - Displays the current Git branch (with `‚éá` symbol) if inside a Git repository.
  - Presents a complete and informative present working directory (PWD) path.
  - Distinguishes root (`#`) and normal user (`$`) prompts.
- **Clipboard Integration:**  
  - Includes the `osc_yank` function for copying text to the system clipboard via OSC52 escape
    sequences, supporting xterm, tmux, and screen.
- **Improved History and Usability:**  
  - Appends to history, ignores duplicates, and sets sensible history sizes.
  - Enables useful shell options: `globstar`, `checkwinsize`, `autoindent`, and more.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository with submodules:**
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sheer-rey/PowerBash.git
    ```

2. **Install the configuration files by running the installer script:**
    ```bash
    cd PowerBash
    ./PowerBash -i
    ```
    By default, this installs to your `$HOME` directory. See `./PowerBash -h` for more information.

3. **Start the new bash environment or re-source your .bashrc to make configuration changes take effect in your shell:**
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

4. **Start a new tmux session to enjoy tmux with the enhanced configuration:**
    ```bash
    tmux
    ```

5. **Open Vim to enjoy the enhanced environment:**
    ```bash
    vim
    ```


## Uninstallation

To uninstall PowerBash and revert to your previous configurations, run the uninstaller script:
```bash
cd PowerBash
./PowerBash -u
```
This will remove the installed configuration files from your `$HOME` directory.

> Notes:  
  Built-in commands work in any Vim. Plugin-provided commands may require the plugin to be installed and loaded (they are included in this project).  
  To find exact commands for a plugin, open its docs under ~/.vim/bundle/{plugin}/doc or use `:Helptags` after installing bundles.  
  If Python support is not available in Vim or Vim version is below 7.4.1126, Leaderf plugin is inactive and CtrlP plugin is fallback to active, otherwise CtrlP plugin is disabled.  
  Check Python support with `:echo has('python')` or `:echo has('python3')` in Vim command mode.  
  Check Vim version with `:version` in Vim command mode.

## Requirements

In order to make PowerBash works properly, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- `git`
- `tmux` (almost versions is compatible, but 3.4 and above recommended)
- `vim` (almost versions is compatible, but 8.1 and above recommended)
- `python2/3` (for various Vim plugins)

And to make full use of all features, it's recommended to also have the following tools:
- `bat` (for syntax highlighting in `man` pages)
- `ack` or `ag` (for fast searching in Vim)
- `ctags` (for taglist and code navigation in Vim)
- `cscope` (for code navigation in Vim)
- `gtags` (for GNU Global tagging system support in Vim)
- `gtags-cscope` (for cscope database generation and code navigation in Vim)
- `rg` (ripgrep, for fuzzy finding in Vim)
- `cppman` (for C++ manual integration in Vim)

With Ubuntu22.04 or later, you can install these tools using:
```bash
sudo apt install -y git tmux vim python3 bat ack silversearcher-ag universal-ctags cscope global ripgrep cppman
```


## Customization

- You can further customize any configuration file in your `HOME/` directory.
- You can further add your own aliases to `~/.bash_aliases`.
- You can further extend Vim with more plugins by adding them to `HOME/.vim/bundle/`.
